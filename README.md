# Gym-Management-OOPS

Using fundamental concepts of Object Orient Programming, we have created a Gym Management Program that resembles a real life gym app, using a very interactive terminal based interface.

**Exercise** - There are two kinds of exercises, Strength and Cardio.

**Person** - The gym consists of 2 different hierarchy of people, Member of the Gym and Gym Trainer.

**Routine** - Routine tells us about which set of exercises to be done by a member on a particular day of the week.

**Gym** - This containts all the data about the gym, which is managed by the admin.
